# Welcome to My Malloc
***

## Task
The task was about to implement the fucntions connected with memory allocation such as malloc, calloc, realloc, free by our own. Before this project I had no idea how actually these functions, right I knew that they are used to allocate and free this memory I'm saying about the proccess going inside these fucntions.

## Description
Initially I thought that it is somehow connected with VM (virtual memory) thats why I started to learn this and around a week was busy learning VM. Then I heard it is not neccessary.Then obviously I started to learn the important stuff.

## Installation
It is not big project and you dont need install it, if you are interested you can download the code from my git repository.

## Usage
you just write mem allocater fucntions in file and write make in terminal, then exucute it ./my_malloc
